abstract = {In the geostatistical inverse problem of subsurface hydrology, continuous hydraulic parameter fields, in most cases hydraulic conductivity, are estimated from measurements of dependent variables, such as hydraulic heads, under the assumption that the parameter fields are autocorrelated random space functions. Upon discretization, the continuous fields become large parameter vectors with O(104−107) elements. While cokriging-like inversion methods have been shown to be efficient for highly resolved parameter fields when the number of measurements is small, they require the calculation of the sensitivity of each measurement with respect to all parameters, which may become prohibitive with large sets of measured data such as those arising from transient groundwater flow. We present a Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method for the geostatistical inverse problem, in which a single adjoint equation needs to be solved to obtain the gradient of the objective function. Using the autocovariance matrix of the parameters as preconditioning matrix, expensive multiplications with its inverse can be avoided, and the number of iterations is significantly reduced. We use a randomized spectral decomposition of the posterior covariance matrix of the parameters to perform a linearized uncertainty quantification of the parameter estimate. The feasibility of the method is tested by virtual examples of head observations in steady-state and transient groundwater flow. These synthetic tests demonstrate that transient data can reduce both parameter uncertainty and time spent conducting experiments, while the presented methods are able to handle the resulting large number of measurements.}

This discussion is accompanied with a description of various advanced features, such as coupling of domains and cut cells, grid modifications such as adaptation and moving domains, high order discretizations and node level performance, non-smooth multigrid methods, and multiscale methods. A brief discussion on current and future development directions of the framework concludes the paper.}

 abstract={The high-dimensionality typically associated with discretized approximations to Gaussian random fields is a considerable hinderance to computationally efficient methods for their simulation. Many direct approaches require spectral decompositions of the associated covariance matrix and so are unable to complete the solving process in a timely fashion, if at all. However under certain conditions, we may construct block-circulant versions of the covariance matrix at hand thereby allowing access to fast-Fourier methods to perform the required operations with impressive speed. We demonstrate how circulant embedding and subsequent simulation can be performed directly in the R language. The approach is currently implemented in C for the R package &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;RandomFields&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, and used in the recently released package &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;lgcp&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;. Motivated by applications dealing with spatial point processes we restrict attention to stationary Gaussian fields on R&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, where sparsity of the covariance matrix cannot necessarily be assumed.},
