# Summary

Parafields is a Python package for the generation of spatially heterogeneous parameter fields
with well-defined, known statistical properties. The use of such fields is a key ingredient of simulation
workflows that involve uncertain, spatially heterogeneous parameters. Application areas include
e.g. soil physics and material sciences.

Parafields is also able to run in parallel using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard through mpi4py [@mpi4py].
In this case, the computational domain is split and only the part of the random field relevant
to a certain process is generated on that process. The generation process is implemented in a performance-oriented
C++ backend library and exposed in Python though an intuitive Python interface.

# Statement of need

*This should summarize why we need this piece of research software, including naming competitors*

# Implementation

Parafields looks back at over ten years of development history: It was first implemented as an extension to the
Dune framework [@dune] for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. This is restriced the potential
user base to users of that software framework, although there was quite some interest in the software from outside this community.
In 2022, we started a huge refactoring: The previous C++ code base [@dune-randomfield] got rewritten to have a weaker dependency on Dune, which
e.g. included a rewrite of the CMake build system [@parafields-core]. In order to open up to a wider user base, a Python interface based written in pybind11 [@pybind11] was added.

When engineering the Python package, we put special emphasis on the following usability aspects: Installability, customizabilility and embedding into existing user workflows.

The recommended installation procedure for parafields is perfectly aligned with the state-of-the-art of the Python language: It is installable through with `pip` and automatically compiles using the CMake build systen of the project through scikit-build [@scikit-build]. Required dependency of the C++ library are automatically fetched and built in the required configuration. For sequential use, we also provide
pre-compiled Python wheels. They are built against the sequential MPI stub library FakeMPI [@fakempi], which allows us to build the sequential and the parallel version from the same code base. Users that want to leverage MPI through mpi4py will instead build the package from source against their system MPI library.

It was a goal of the design of the Python API to expose as much of the flexibility of the underlying C++ framework as possible.
In order to do so, we use pybind11's capabilities to pass Python callables to the C++ backend.
This allows users to e.g. implement custom covariance functions or random number generators.

In order to embed perfectly into existing user workflows, the Python API is entirely based on numpy arrays [@numpy].
Furthermore, we acknowledge the fact that many Python users write scientific applications within Jupyter: Our fields render nicely as images in Jupyter and field generation can optionally be configured
through an interactive widget frontend within Jupyter.
